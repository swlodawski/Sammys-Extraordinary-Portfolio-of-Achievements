     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <h4>My name is Samuel Wlodawski and I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. Growing up I always loved
        learning about technology and posessed a great eye for deatail. As the years went by I soaked up
        knowledge of computers and how they function. This led me to persue a job as a developer. But 
        this hasn'ty been easy. It has taken time and effort to reach my aspirations. Part of which include
        building various webpages and quality apllications to gain the knowledge and experience necessary
        to pursue such an endevor.
