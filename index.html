    <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>My name is Samuel Wlodawski and I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. Growing up I always 
        loved learning about technology and possessed a great eye for detail. As the years went
        by I soaked up knowledge of computers and how they function. This led me to persue a job
        as a developer. But this hasn't been easy. It has taken time and effort to reach my 
        aspirations. Part of which include building various webpages and quality applications to
        gain the knowledge and experience necessary to pursue such an endeavor.
