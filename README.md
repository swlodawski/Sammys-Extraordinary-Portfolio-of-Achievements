# Sammys-Extraordinary-Portfolio-of-Achievements

# My Portfolio Site

I was asked to create a web portfolio site using HTML and CSS elements. This site would highlight my achievements and emerging skills as a web developer and give insight into some of the projects I have created and will ultimately create.
Within this site I was asked to put together a nav header that would navigate to each particular section of my portfolio page.
Next, I was asked to create a small about me section that would allow me to tell a little about my past and aspirations.
I was asked to include a work section that would allow prospective employers and recruiters to venture to embedded links that showcase various projects, upon which, I have worked.
Lastly, I was asked to create a set of contact me nav links. Within the set of links, I would present my phone number and email information as well an the embedded href link to my personal GitHub repository.
